This dataset was sourced from Kaggle, based on car listings from oto.my, a Malaysian website specializing in reconditioned (recond) car sales. The purpose of this project was to explore and analyze patterns in car prices, seller types, warranties, and other sales-related insights.

Using SQL, I performed a series of analyses to answer key business questions such as:

- How car prices vary based on seller type and warranty.
- The average price difference between cars of different colors.
- Price distribution by body type in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.
- Yearly trends in car price and mileage.
- Identification of best-selling car makes and models.
- Estimation of total revenue based on available data.

This analysis helps both buyers and sellers to better understand the pricing trends and sales patterns within the Malaysian reconditioned car market.
